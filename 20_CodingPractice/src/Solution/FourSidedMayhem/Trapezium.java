		// sides 'the bases'
		// You can think of this triangle as the original trapezium with
		// the largest possible parallelogram removed from it
		// As per diagram below we need the area of Triangle ADE which
		// is trapezium ABCD less parallelogram ABCE
		// Length DE = DC - AB (difference in length of parallel bases)
		// Then we can get the height of it which is the height of
		// the trapezium
		// A ___a___ B
		// /\ \
		// c / \e \ d
		// / \ \
		// /______\_______\
		// D b E a C
		// So we need 1st the area of Triangle ADE whose sides are
		// 'c' (slantingSide1)
		// 'e' which is equal to 'd' (slantingSide2) and
		// 'b' which is actually the length of DE
		// i.e the difference between the bases
		//
		// Problem only occurs if bases are same length as then you have
		// a triangle with one side (the base) of length 0
		// (effectively a triangle consisting of 2 straight lines on top of
		// each other!) and then Hero's formula comes back with an Area = 0.
		// Then when you do the Height = 2 * Area / Base calculation you are
		// dividing by 0.00 and then Height comes out at double.Nan
		// and it all gets messy.
		// So an alternative approach is needed only when your trapezium
		// is actually a parallelogram, i.e it has 2 sets of parallel sides
		// (it might be a rectangle or even a square but they are both
		// parallelograms)
		// So in this case we would need to use a different technique..one
		// that calculates the area of a parallelogram.
		// This revolves around calculating the area of a different triangle,
		// namely one of the 2 congruent triangles that you get when you
		// split a parallelogram in half by creating a line across the
		// diagonals.
